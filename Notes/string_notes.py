first_name = input("What is your first name?:\n").strip().title()

last_name = input("What is your last name?:\n").strip().title()

full_name = first_name + " "+ last_name

sentence = '          The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog    ' 
print (sentence.strip())

print("Welcome to my program", full_name + "!")
